This is where it used to say "Welcome to the Glitch BETA"
But I changed it, to make this my own >:)
=========================

This was a Free Code Camp assignnment

It's not tough execute, but it's definitely tough to understand. I took my time on it, really trying to understand each piece. It became a steep learning curve, but it was worth it.

Hope this helps someone.

**Peace**,

'Edwin'

Also, I made this using Glitch. That was fun. Find out more [about Glitch](https://glitch.com/about).


Timestamp Microserviice
------------

- Home page points to views/index.html
- Home page provides instructions for the API
- Home page uses the word "normietime"

On the back-end,
- your app starts at `server.js`
- I created a module exports (I don't know what it's really called yet) 'timestuff' 
--I'm still not certain about when I should use camelCase...should timestuff be timeStuff? If yes, then why?
